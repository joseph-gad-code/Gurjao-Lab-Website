<!-- SECTION 1 -->
<div class="research-container img-right">
  <div class="research-copy">
    <h2>What causes cancer mutations?</h2>

    <p>Every person’s tumour tells a story—our lifestyle habits, our microbes, even our immune system shape the tumour’s DNA and can leave marks. We aim to discover and study such marks to understand how cancer develops.</p>

    <p><em>Our discoveries so far:</em></p>
    <ul class="dash-list">
      <li>Discovered a mutational pattern linked to dietary habits, in particular red meat intake.</li>
      <li>Identified a subpopulation that is particularly susceptible to DNA damage from such habits.</li>
      <li>Assessed the long-term effects of smoking on the colorectal cancer genomes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In collaborations, we also assessed how alcohol and certain bacterial strains leave mutational marks.</p>

<!-- SECTION 2 -->
<div class="research-container img-left">
  <div class="research-copy">
    <h2>How can tumor mutations guide treatment?</h2>

    <p>Cancer immunotherapies are transforming treatment, yet not all patients respond the same way. Studying the mutational landscape of tumors can inform the best course of treatment and predict aggressiveness.</p>

    <p><em>Our discoveries so far:</em></p>
    <ul class="dash-list">
      <li>Resistance to immunotherapy: identified intrinsic resistance to immune checkpoint blockade in mismatch repair–deficient colorectal cancer.</li>
      <li>Hidden cancers: clinically and genomically characterized interval colorectal cancers across three prospective cohorts.</li>
      <li>Germline predisposition to oncogenic alkylating damage in colorectal cancer.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We have also contributed to studies on how tumor cells change after treatment, and how specific genetic contexts influence sensitivity to therapy.</p>

  <div class="research-copy">
    <h2>Novel experimental and computational methods</h2>

    <p>We work closely with clinicians and physicists to push the boundaries of how cancer is studied. Together, we are developing new approaches to:</p>

    <ul class="dash-list">
      <li>Map the spatial architecture of tumors—understanding how cancer cells interact with their surroundings within tissues; to do so, we engineer tools.</li>
      <li>Reveal hidden microbial signals in tumor data—creating better ways to detect and analyze microbes that may influence cancer development.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These tools help answer fundamental questions about cancer biology and provide the community with new methods to accelerate discovery.</p>
