  bio: >
    Valentin investigates hypermutated colorectal cancer using multimodal data
    to study the tumor microenvironment's reshaping over time. His work focuses
    on the interplay between DNA repair, immune surveillance and evasion, and
    other competing forces that shape tumor evolution.

  bio: >
    Joseph investigates how microbial DNA/RNA can be accurately identified in
    tumor bulk sequencing data, focusing on reducing technical and biological
    biases. He is developing robust methods to improve the reliability of
    metagenomic analyses in cancer research.
