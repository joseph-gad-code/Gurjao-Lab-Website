      While 80% of cancers are thought to be preventable, only about 5% of cancer
      funding goes toward prevention.

      By understanding how mutations occur, we are moving science closer to
      stopping cancer before it starts and spreads.

      The number of cancer treatments has exploded in recent years, creating a

      By decoding each tumor’s genetic profile, we are informing tailored cancer
      treatments.

      <h2>Our mission</h2>
      <p>
        We aim to deliver data-driven precision prevention and precision treatment. Our work broadly focuses on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Why mutations occur: How lifestyle, microbes, the immune system, and DNA three-dimensional structure leave their mark on the genome.</li>
        <li>How this knowledge guides treatment: Using tumor mutations to predict which therapies will work best.</li>
        <li>Building new tools: Developing computational and experimental approaches with clinicians and physicists to push cancer research forward.</li>
      </ul>
