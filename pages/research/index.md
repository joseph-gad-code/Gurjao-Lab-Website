      <h2>What causes cancer mutations?</h2>

      <p>Every person’s tumour tells a story—our lifestyle habits, our microbes, even our immune system shape the tumour’s DNA and can leave marks. We aim to discover and study such marks to understand how cancer develops.</p>

      <p><em>Our discoveries so far:</em></p>
      <ul class="dash-list">
        <li>Discovered a mutational pattern linked to dietary habits, in particular red meat intake.</li>
        <li>Identified a subpopulation that is particularly susceptible to DNA damage from such habits.</li>
        <li>Assessed the long-term effects of smoking on the colorectal cancer genomes.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In collaborations, we also assessed how alcohol and certain bacterial strains leave mutational marks.</p>

      <h2>How can tumor mutations guide treatment?</h2>

      <p>Cancer immunotherapies are transforming treatment, yet not all patients respond the same way. Studying the mutational landscape of tumors can inform the best course of treatment and predict aggressiveness.</p>

      <p><em>Our discoveries so far:</em></p>
      <ul class="dash-list">
        <li>Resistance to immunotherapy: identified intrinsic resistance to immune checkpoint blockade in mismatch repair–deficient colorectal cancer.</li>
        <li>Hidden cancers: clinically and genomically characterized interval colorectal cancers across three prospective cohorts.</li>
        <li>Germline predisposition to oncogenic alkylating damage in colorectal cancer.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We also contributed to studies on how tumor cells change after treatment, and how specific genetic contexts influence sensitivity to therapy.</p>
