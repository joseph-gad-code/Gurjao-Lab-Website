        <p>
          Every person’s tumour tells a story—our lifestyle habits, our microbes, even our immune system shape the tumour’s DNA and can leave marks. We aim to discover and study such marks to understand how cancer develops.
        </p>

        <p><em>Our discoveries so far:</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Discovered a mutational pattern linked to dietary habits, in particular red meat intake.</li>
          <li>Identified a subpopulation that is particularly susceptible to DNA damage from such habits.</li>
          <li>Assessed the long-term effects of smoking on the colorectal cancer genomes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In collaborations, we also assessed how alcohol and certain bacterial strains leave mutational marks.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">How can tumor mutations guide treatment?</h2>

        <p>
          Cancer immunotherapies are transforming treatment, yet not all patients respond the same way. Studying the mutational landscape of tumors can inform the best course of treatment and predict aggressiveness.
        </p>

        <p><em>Our discoveries so far:</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Resistance to immunotherapy: Identified intrinsic resistance to immune checkpoint blockade in mismatch repair–deficient colorectal cancer.</li>
          <li>Hidden cancers: Clinically and genomically characterized interval colorectal cancers across three prospective cohorts.</li>
          <li>Germline predisposition to oncogenic alkylating damage in colorectal cancer.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We also study how tumor cells change after treatment, and how specific genetic contexts (e.g., RNF43 / NTHL1) influence sensitivity to therapy.

        <h2 class="section-title">Novel experimental and computational methods</h2>

        <p>
          We work closely with clinicians and physicists to push the boundaries of how cancer is studied. Together, we are developing new approaches to:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Map the spatial architecture of tumors — understanding how cancer cells interact with its surrounding within tissues. To do so, we engineer tools.</li>
          <li>Reveal hidden microbial signals in tumor data — creating better ways to detect and analyze microbes that may influence cancer development.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          These tools not only help us answer fundamental questions about cancer biology but also provide the scientific community with new methods to accelerate discovery.
